# ParaNOTnormal_Investigating
# Overview
This repository is a fun mini RPG made with PyGame for the 2023 ACC Coding Challenge. This is a simple RPG revolving around a boy and his adventure as a newly hired ghost hunter. 
# How to Play
You can use WASD or Arrow Keys to move your player around. Simply traverse the world to find keys and talk to those around you to carry on through the story. But watch out for ghosts! If you find yourself in contact with a ghost make sure to catch them with your ghost vacuum. 
# Design
## Game
### The "Game" class contains all of the methods needed to start up the game. Some duties that the Game class manages are:
- Tile maps
- Start Screen
- Gameplay
- Game Over Screen
## Sprites
### We also used a "Sprites" document to contain multiple classes for each object/character needed in the game. The purposes of these classes are:
- Load the image on the screen
- Animate the sprites
- Add collision to the sprites
- Show text interactions with the sprites
### All of the art (with the exception of the music) for ParaNOTnormal Investigating was made by hand by the team members.
## Controls:
- R: Attack
- Space: Next dialogue
- Make sure to click the ghost before you kill it!!
# The game ends once you kill the ghost!
